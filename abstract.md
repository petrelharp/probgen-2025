Title: Dating large ARGs, with clinical applications

Modern methods allow ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs) to be inferred at the biobank scale. Two potentially transformative advantages to using these for analysis are that the ARG (1) situates genetic variation along the time axis; and (2) describes genetic variation without recourse to imprecise notions of discrete populations. To realize these advantages, ARG inference needs to be sufficiently accurate that summaries from inferred ARGs accurately represent the corresponding quantities in the true, unobserved ARG. We have developed a new variational Bayes method for dating inferred ARGs, and applied the method to 95,000 whole genomes from the Genomics England dataset. Accuracy is very high and increases strongly with sample size, as demonstrated by comparing inferred ages to simulation and in real data against aDNA constraints. We also show that inferred ages of ultra-rare mutations can provide evidence against pathogenicity, and so inferred age provides a potential clinical alternative to allele frequency that does not depend on division into discrete populations.
